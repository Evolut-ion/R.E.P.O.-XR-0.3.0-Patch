Install Instructions:

1. Install Thunderstore
2. Select a profile for R.E.P.O
3. Download 1.0.3 of R.E.P.O XR
4. replace RepoXR.dll in the plugin location for DaXcess-RepoXR with this Repositories RepoXR.dll


This was only made for fun while R.E.P.O XR isn't updated. All credit goes to

As without his work this would not further be possible.
